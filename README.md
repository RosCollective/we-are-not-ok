# WE ARE NOT OKAY (WANOK)

This repository contains a very short book of observations.
It exists to be read in between more serious things.
Think a cigarette break, a shared hallway laugh, staring at the wall for thirty seconds.

## What This Is Not
This is not a manifesto, a debate, or a place for posture.
## Tone
Deadpan preferred, punchlines optional, explanation discouraged.
## Contributions
If this resonates with you, please share your small slice of lived humor.
## Guidelines:
Just: “This thing happened.”
