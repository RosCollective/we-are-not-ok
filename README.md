# WE ARE NOT OKAY (WANOK)

This repository contains very short pieces.

They are observational.
They are calm.
They are sometimes funny.

They exist to be read in between more serious things.
Like a cigarette break.
Or a hallway laugh.
Or staring at the wall for thirty seconds.

## What This Is Not

This is not a manifesto.
This is not a debate.
This is not a place to posture.

If you feel the urge to explain why something is important,
it probably does not belong here.

## Tone

Deadpan is preferred.
Punchlines are optional.
Explanation is discouraged.

If it reads like you are trying to sound clever,
please remove one sentence.
Then another.

## Contributions

If this resonates with you,
you are welcome to contribute a small slice of lived humor.

Guidelines:

- Keep it short.
- Make it feel like it actually happened (or could have).
- Do not explain it.
- Do not try to win an argument.

No posturing.
No virtue signaling.
No grand conclusions.

Just:

“This thing happened.”

And then stop.
