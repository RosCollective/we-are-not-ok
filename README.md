# WE ARE NOT OKAY (WANOK)
A ROS Collective project.

This repository contains a very short book of observations. 
It exists to be read in between more serious things — a cigarette break, a shared hallway laugh, staring at the wall for thirty seconds.

This is not a manifesto, a debate, or a place for posture. Tone is deadpan. Punchlines are optional. Explanation is discouraged.

If this resonates with you, you’re welcome to share a small slice of lived humor. Just: “This thing happened.”
